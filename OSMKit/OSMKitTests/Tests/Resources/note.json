There is a roller shutter concealing a shopfront across most of the width at the Friern Barnet side. There is a small roller shutter about 4 feet across the corner bevel, concealing an entrance door. The Carlton Road side is mostly hidden by an advertising hoarding -- maybe there is a storefront behind it, but the hoarding looks fairly permanent. The shutters were down (at 3pm in the afternoon) so I think the shop may not be in current use. Consequently I'm just adding the corner bevel, adjusting the perimeter to be more like that on bing but not adding any shop details unless somebody cares to re-open this.","html":"\u003cp\u003eI'd hardly describe it as a continuous shopfront.
